Q	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Ans --> When we  initialise a repository then a .git file is created storing all the history that should be stored. There is 0 commits as confirmed from git log. There will be some untracked files. Git does not commit all the files to the repo , bcoz then we don't have the opportunity to be selective and we will not be able to give name to our message.


Q.	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans --> staging area is different from working directory in the sense that it stores the list of files which we want to commit and working directory is there area where e actually store our whole local repo. It offers the user the ability to be selective to which files the user want to commit.


Q. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Ans --> commiting when we have done one logical change.
